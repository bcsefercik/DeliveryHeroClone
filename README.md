# DeliveryHeroClone
## Description
This project clones the basic features of deliveryhero. It is developed for my Database Systems class. 
I had coded entire project in 2-3 days. Therefore, there might be some bugs in both frontend and backend. Sorry for that.

## Setup
You can start to use the code in three steps:
- Create the necessary MySQL tables by dumping tables.sql
- Set _$site_address_ in **includes/config.php** to your URL.
- Write your database information to **includes/database.php**.

You are done. Have fun:)
